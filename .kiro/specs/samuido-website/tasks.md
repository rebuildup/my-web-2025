# Implementation Plan

Based on analysis of the current codebase and requirements, this implementation plan bridges the gap between the current basic Next.js setup and the comprehensive samuido website requirements.

**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS (Updated):**

- ✅ Next.js 15.4.3 with App Router and TypeScript configured
- ✅ All required packages installed (React 19.1.0, Tailwind CSS 4.x, testing tools)
- ✅ Basic testing environment configured (Jest, Playwright, Lighthouse CI)
- ✅ Basic build, test, and lint scripts working (npm run build ✓, npm run test ✓, npm run lint ✓)
- ✅ Basic Tailwind CSS 4.x integration with PostCSS configured
- ✅ Default Next.js home page and layout working
- ❌ Missing: Custom Tailwind configuration with design system from documents/02_style.md
- ❌ Missing: TypeScript interfaces and data structures from documents/01_global.md
- ❌ Missing: File-based data management system (public/data/ structure)
- ❌ Missing: All custom page implementations, API routes, components
- ❌ Missing: Custom design system implementation with fonts and colors
- ❌ Missing: All samuido-specific content and functionality

**NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS:**

1. Start with Task 1.1.3: Configure Tailwind CSS with custom design system
2. Then Task 1.1.4: Implement core TypeScript interfaces
3. Then Task 1.1.5: Set up file-based data management system

**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR EVERY TASK:**

- 100% test pass rates: `npm run lint` (0 errors), `npm run build` (success), `npm run test` (100% pass), `npm run type-check` (0 errors), `npm run lint:md` (0 errors), `prettier --check .` (0 issues)
- Lighthouse CI: 100% scores in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO
- Every task MUST reference documents/ directory for implementation guidance
- **ALL PAGE STYLES MUST FOLLOW ROOT PAGE DESIGN PATTERNS**: Use src/app/page.tsx as the style reference for consistent design system implementation across all pages
- **GLOBAL DESIGN SYSTEM COMPLIANCE**: All components MUST use the unified design system from Style.md including:
  - Typography: neue-haas-grotesk-display, zen-kaku-gothic-new, noto-sans-jp-light, noto-sans-jp-regular, shippori-antique-b1-regular
  - Colors: text-primary, text-foreground, text-accent, bg-base, bg-background, border-foreground
  - Layout: container-system, grid-system, grid-1/2/3/4, space-y-_, gap-_
  - Components: bg-base border border-foreground p-4 pattern for cards
- Site structure MUST support easy modification and extension (flexible architecture)
- All implementations MUST be production-ready and maintainable
