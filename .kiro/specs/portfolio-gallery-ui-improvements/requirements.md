# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the user interface and user experience across multiple portfolio gallery pages. The improvements address visual inconsistencies, layout issues, text overflow problems, and navigation elements to create a more polished and professional portfolio presentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing the portfolio, I want consistent scrollbar behavior so that the layout doesn't shift when content changes between scrollable and non-scrollable states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content requires scrolling THEN the scrollbar SHALL be visible
2. WHEN content does not require scrolling THEN the system SHALL maintain the same layout width by either showing a persistent scrollbar or reserving equivalent space
3. WHEN transitioning between scrollable and non-scrollable states THEN the layout SHALL NOT shift or cause visual jitter

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing the portfolio/gallery/all page, I want relevant category filters so that I can find the content I'm looking for without unnecessary options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the portfolio/gallery/all page THEN the system SHALL NOT display "Video&Design" as a filter option
2. WHEN viewing the portfolio/gallery/all page THEN the system SHALL display "Design" as a separate filter option
3. WHEN selecting the "Design" filter THEN the system SHALL show only design-related portfolio items

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing portfolio cards on the all gallery page, I want consistent text display so that card layouts are uniform and readable.

4. WHEN tags exceed the available space THEN the system SHALL display additional tags as "+N" format where N is the count of hidden tags

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing the portfolio/gallery/develop page, I want properly sized UI elements so that all text is readable and doesn't overflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the "Descending" button THEN the button SHALL be sized to contain all text without overflow
2. WHEN the button text changes THEN the button size SHALL adjust appropriately to prevent text clipping

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user viewing video portfolio cards, I want consistent and clean card layouts so that information is well-organized and readable.

2. WHEN displaying tags on video cards THEN tags SHALL be positioned above the date
3. WHEN tags exceed one line THEN the system SHALL use "+N" format for additional tags
4. WHEN displaying video card thumbnails THEN the system SHALL NOT show any overlay icons in the top-right corner

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user interacting with video&design gallery items, I want smooth hover effects so that the interaction feels polished and intentional.

2. WHEN hovering over video&design gallery items THEN only the image SHALL scale/zoom
3. WHEN hovering over video&design gallery items THEN the border/frame SHALL remain static and not move

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user viewing the video&design gallery grid, I want a well-organized layout so that all items are properly aligned regardless of content amount.

3. WHEN the grid layout is calculated THEN all rows SHALL maintain consistent spacing and alignment

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user viewing the main portfolio page's "Browse by Category" section, I want consistent and clean navigation cards so that the interface looks professional and organized.
