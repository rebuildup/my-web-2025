## Pre-Migration Checklist

### Before You Start

- [ ] **Backup your data**: Ensure you have a complete backup of your portfolio data
- [ ] **Test environment**: Perform migration in a development environment first
- [ ] **Review content**: Identify which items need migration
- [ ] **Plan timeline**: Don't migrate everything at once
- [ ] **Check disk space**: Ensure sufficient space for markdown files
- [ ] **Verify permissions**: Confirm write access to the markdown directory

### System Requirements

- Node.js environment with file system access
- Write permissions to `public/data/content/markdown/` directory
- Sufficient disk space (estimate ~2KB per portfolio item)
- Modern browser for using the data manager interface

### Content Assessment

Before migration, assess your existing content:

1. **Count items to migrate**: Check how many portfolio items have text content
2. **Identify complex content**: Note items with special formatting or embedded references
3. **Review media references**: Ensure all referenced images, videos, and links are properly indexed
4. **Check content length**: Very long content may need manual review after migration

## Understanding the Migration

### What Changes During Migration

#### Before Migration

```json
{
  "id": "portfolio-123",
  "title": "My Project",
  "content": "This is a detailed description of my project. It includes information about the technology stack and implementation details.",
  "images": ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"],
  "videos": [{ "url": "video1.mp4", "title": "Demo" }],
  "externalLinks": [{ "url": "https://demo.com", "title": "Live Demo" }]
}
```

#### After Migration

```json
{
  "id": "portfolio-123",
  "title": "My Project",
  "content": "This is a detailed description...", // Kept for backward compatibility
  "markdownPath": "portfolio/portfolio-123.md",
  "markdownMigrated": true,
  "images": ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"],
  "videos": [{ "url": "video1.mp4", "title": "Demo" }],
  "externalLinks": [{ "url": "https://demo.com", "title": "Live Demo" }]
}
```

#### Created Markdown File (`portfolio/portfolio-123.md`)

```markdown
# My Project

This is a detailed description of my project. It includes information about the technology stack and implementation details.

```

### Migration Safety Features

1. **Original content preserved**: The original `content` field is kept for rollback
2. **Incremental migration**: Migrate items one at a time or in small batches
3. **Automatic backup**: System creates backups before migration
4. **Rollback capability**: Can revert to original content if needed
5. **Validation checks**: System validates migration success

## Automatic Migration Process

### Using the Data Manager Interface

1. **Access Data Manager**
   - Open your portfolio data manager
   - Navigate to the portfolio items section

2. **Identify Items for Migration**
   - Look for items with a "Migrate to Markdown" button
   - Items with existing text content will show migration status
   - Priority indicators help you decide migration order

3. **Start Migration**

   ```
   Click "Migrate to Markdown" â†’ Review Preview â†’ Confirm Migration
   ```

4. **Review Results**
   - Check the generated markdown file
   - Verify that embeds are correctly placed
   - Test the content display on detail pages

### Bulk Migration Options

#### Migrate All Items

```javascript
// Available in data manager console
await migrateAllToMarkdown({
  batchSize: 5, // Process 5 items at a time
  validateAfter: true, // Validate each migration
  createBackup: true, // Create backup before migration
  skipErrors: true, // Continue if individual items fail
});
```

#### Migrate by Category

```javascript
// Migrate specific categories first
await migrateCategoryToMarkdown("web-development", {
  validateAfter: true,
  createBackup: true,
});
```

### Migration Status Tracking

The system tracks migration progress:

- **Not Started**: Item has text content but no markdown file
- **In Progress**: Migration is currently running
- **Completed**: Successfully migrated to markdown
- **Failed**: Migration encountered errors
- **Skipped**: Item was intentionally skipped

## Manual Migration Process

### When to Use Manual Migration

- Complex content with special formatting
- Content that needs significant restructuring
- Items with embedded HTML or special characters
- When you want full control over the migration process

### Step-by-Step Manual Migration

#### 1. Prepare the Content

```markdown
# Original Content

"This is my project description. It uses React and Node.js.
Check out the demo at https://demo.com and the code at https://github.com/user/repo."

# Planned Markdown Structure

# Project Title

This is my project description. It uses **React** and **Node.js**.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB

## Links

[link:0 "Live Demo"]
[link:1 "Source Code"]
```

#### 2. Create Markdown File

1. Open the data manager
2. Select the portfolio item
3. Navigate to the markdown editor
4. Paste and format your content
5. Add embed references for media

#### 3. Structure Your Content

```markdown

   - Schedule quarterly content reviews
   - Update outdated information
   - Add new screenshots or demos

2. **SEO Optimization**
   - Use proper heading hierarchy
   - Include relevant keywords naturally
   - Add descriptive alt text for images

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor page load times
   - Optimize large images or videos
   - Consider lazy loading for media-heavy content

## Troubleshooting Migration Issues

### Common Migration Problems

#### Migration Fails with "Permission Denied"

**Problem**: Cannot write markdown files to the directory.

**Solutions**:

1. Check file system permissions for `public/data/content/markdown/`
2. Ensure the web server has write access
3. Try running with elevated permissions (development only)
4. Check disk space availability

#### Content Appears Corrupted After Migration

**Problem**: Special characters or formatting is broken.

**Solutions**:

1. Check the original content for encoding issues
2. Manually review and fix the markdown file
3. Use the rollback feature to revert and try again
4. Consider manual migration for complex content

#### Embed References Don't Work

**Problem**: `![image:0]` shows as text instead of displaying media.

**Solutions**:

1. Verify the media arrays have content at the specified indices
2. Check that image/video URLs are valid and accessible
3. Ensure the embed syntax is exactly correct
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

#### Migration Status Stuck on "In Progress"

**Problem**: Migration process appears to hang.

**Solutions**:

1. Refresh the page and check if migration completed
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Try migrating individual items instead of bulk migration
4. Restart the development server if running locally

### Recovery Procedures

#### Rollback Migration

If migration causes issues:

1. **Automatic Rollback**

   ```javascript
   // In data manager console
   await rollbackMigration("portfolio-item-id");
   ```

2. **Manual Rollback**
   - Remove the `markdownPath` field from the item data
   - Set `markdownMigrated` to `false`
   - Delete the corresponding markdown file
   - The system will fall back to the original `content` field

#### Repair Corrupted Migration

1. **Identify the Issue**
   - Check the markdown file content
   - Verify embed references
   - Test content display

2. **Fix the Content**
   - Edit the markdown file directly
   - Use the data manager editor
   - Re-run migration with corrected source content

3. **Validate the Fix**
   - Test on detail pages
   - Check all embed references
   - Verify responsive design

## Best Practices

### Migration Strategy

1. **Start Small**
   - Migrate 1-2 items first
   - Test thoroughly before proceeding
   - Learn from initial migrations

2. **Prioritize by Impact**
   - Migrate high-visibility items first
   - Focus on items with rich media content
   - Save simple text-only items for last

3. **Plan for Enhancement**
   - Don't just convert text to markdown
   - Plan to add media embeds and better formatting
   - Consider the user experience improvements

### Content Organization

1. **Consistent Structure**

   ```markdown
   # Project Title

   ## Overview

   ## Key Features

   ## Screenshots/Media

   ## Technology Stack

   ## Implementation Details

   ## Results/Impact

   ## Links
   ```

2. **Media Strategy**
   - Place hero images early in content
   - Group related screenshots together
   - Include demo videos in logical positions
   - Use call-to-action sections for links

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Always include responsive classes
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Consider mobile-first approach
